📛 Hi, I’m Jakub Baranowski.

👔 I'm a Senior QA Engineer @GOG.com, where I mostly work with Python and Selenium.

✨ In my spare time I like to tinker with game development/modding and web development.

🌱 Lately, I've been learning:

* 🎮 Blender, Godot and GDScript for game development,
* 🕸  GoLang, Docker, Kubernetes for web development.

📫 You can reach me via email *jbaranowski (at) rubberduckling.dev*.

🙇 GLHF!
