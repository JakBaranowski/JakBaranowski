ğŸ“› Hi, Iâ€™m Jakub Baranowski.

ğŸ‘” I'm a Senior QA Engineer @GOG.com.

âœ¨ In my spare time I like to tinker with game development/modding and web development.

ğŸ§© I enjoy solving problems no matter what they are, and because of that I'm always learning something new.

ğŸŒ± Lately, I've been working with Blender and Godot.

ğŸ“« You can reach me via email *jbaranowski (at) rubberduckling.dev*.

ğŸ™‡ GLHF!
